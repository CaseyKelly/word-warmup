## Word Cloud


## Stories
- Build a word cloud out of the words in data.rb
- there is a spec file you can write tests in.
- Go through the list of sayings/words and count how many times each word shows up.
- The result should be a hash that looks like this:

{
  "one-to-one" => 7,
  "ENGINEER" => 12,
  "TRANSFORM" => 25
}
